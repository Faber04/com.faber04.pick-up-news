# <img src="public/pickupnews-mark.svg" width="36" height="36" align="absmiddle" /> PickUpNews

**A web application to read RSS feeds in a single elegant and intuitive interface.**

🌐 **Live Demo**: [www.faber04.com/app/pick-up-news](https://www.faber04.com/app/pick-up-news/)

PickUpNews allows you to easily aggregate and read all your favorite RSS feeds. Manually add your RSS feeds, view news in chronological order or grouped by site, and read full articles with a simple click.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📡 RSS Feed Management**: Easily add and remove RSS feeds manually
- **🌍 Bilingual UI Foundation**: Interface available in Italian and English with persistent language preference
- **🏳️ Language Settings**: Dedicated Settings subpage for language selection with flag + native label
- **↕️ Feed Ordering**: Reorder feeds in the Feeds page and keep order persisted in localStorage
- **🖱️ Drag & Drop Ordering**: Reorder feeds by dragging directly in the Feeds page
- **📲 Touch Drag & Drop**: Feed drag & drop sorting also works on mobile touch devices
- **✏️ Feed Editing**: Edit feed name and URL with real-time URL validation and save confirmation
- **🔄 Instant Feed Reload on Edit**: Saving feed edits reloads the feed and updates "Last updated"
- **🧠 Auto Feed Detection**: Enter a website URL and PickUpNews auto-detects JSON Feed first, then RSS/Atom
- **🧯 Inline Add Feed Errors**: If detection fails, the add panel stays open and shows an inline URL error (no modal alerts)
- **🛑 Duplicate Protection**: Duplicate feed URLs are blocked with immediate inline feedback
- **🧩 Multi-Format Support**: Native support for JSON Feed, RSS 2.0, and Atom feeds
- **⚙️ Settings Hub**: Menu first, mobile-first settings page with top actions for theme and feed management
- **🧭 Breadcrumb Navigation**: Sticky breadcrumb for fast movement between pages and nested subpages
- **📅 Chronological View**: See all news sorted by date (most recent first)
- **🏷️ Site View**: Group news by source/site
- **🗂️ Collapsed By-Site Start**: In "By Site" view, all accordions start collapsed to improve navigation with many feeds
- **🧰 By-Site Controls**: "Espandi tutti" / "Comprimi tutti" quick actions and open/total counter
- **💾 Accordion State Persistence**: Open/closed state per feed is remembered in localStorage
- **🧭 Consistent Source Order**: In "By Site" mode, Home follows the same order configured in Feeds
- **🧱 Mobile Navigation Drawer**: On mobile, navigation opens as a right-side drawer with overlay
- **🗓️ Compact Article Metadata**: Article modal uses compact `DD/MM/YY (HH:MM)` date format and wraps metadata cleanly on mobile
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Perfect on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **💾 Local Persistence**: Your feeds are automatically saved in the browser
- **🔍 Smart Preview**: Descriptions truncated to 120 characters for quick reading
- **📖 Full Reading**: Modal with full article and original link
- **⚡ Parallel Feed Detection**: Candidate probes run concurrently — detection worst case is O(timeout) regardless of candidate count
- **⚡ Performance**: Fast loading thanks to Vite and React optimizations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 4 (fast development and optimized build)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3 (utility-first CSS framework)
- **RSS Parsing**: Custom XML parser via the browser's native `DOMParser` (supports RSS 2.0 and Atom)
- **Routing**: React Router DOM (for future expansions)
- **State Management**: React Hooks + localStorage
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript 5 (full type safety)

## 🌐 RSS Architecture and CORS Management

RSS feeds are read directly from the browser using a 2-level proxy/fallback chain to maximize availability:

| Level | Service | Method | Item Limit |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1st (primary) | [corsproxy.io](https://corsproxy.io) | Returns raw XML → parsed with `DOMParser` | All feed items |
| 2nd (final fallback) | [rss2json.com](https://rss2json.com) | Returns pre-parsed JSON | Max 10 items (free tier) |

Each call is protected by a **10-second timeout** using `AbortController`: if a proxy does not respond within the limit, it automatically switches to the next one. Items are always sorted by descending date (most recent first) with cross-browser normalization of the date format.

## 📖 How to Use PickUpNews

### Navigation
The app has two top-level sections accessible from the header:
- **🏠 Home** — the list of news from your feeds
- **⚙️ Settings** — app info, credits, and access to feed management

### Adding an RSS Feed
1. Open **Settings** from the header
2. Click **"Gestisci Feed"**
3. Click on **"+ Add RSS Feed"**
4. Enter the feed name (e.g., "The Guardian")
5. Enter a website URL or feed URL (e.g., `theguardian.com` or `https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss`)
6. Click **"Add Feed"**
7. PickUpNews tries automatic detection (JSON Feed first, then RSS/Atom)
8. If no valid feed is detected, the panel stays open and an inline error appears under the URL field
9. Correct the URL and retry without reopening the add panel

### Viewing News
From the **Home** section, you can choose two viewing modes:
- **Chronological**: all news from all feeds sorted by the most recent
- **By Site**: news grouped by source/site

In **By Site** mode:
- Accordions start collapsed by default
