## Error: TypeError: this.removeAllListeners is not a function (FINAL RESOLUTION)
- Date: 15 April 2026
- Error Description: Application crashed with TypeError when trying to parse RSS feeds. Error occurred in compiled JavaScript at assets-index-*.js files
- Cause: rss-parser is a Node.js library that uses server-side modules (http, https, events, streams) which are not available in browsers
- Solution: Replaced rss-parser with a custom browser-compatible RSS parser using native fetch() and DOMParser APIs
- Prevention: Always use browser-compatible libraries for client-side applications. Test RSS parsing functionality thoroughly before deployment
